# 07/27-css-gradient-generator

I will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [vite bundler](https://vitejs.dev/).

This project is all about building a CSS gradient generator tool that can be used to easily create and customize beautiful gradients for web designs.
